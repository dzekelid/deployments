  title: Predix Analytics Framework Deploy an analytic with an optional deployment
    configuration by analytic catalog entry id.
  version: 1.0.0
  description: This operation FORCE deploys the specified analytic into the Cloud
    Foundry environment with an optional deployment configuration, responds with the
    request id (generated for the request), and the current request status.  The force
    deploy usually takes longer than the standard timeout, so the calling process
    should use the returned request id to monitor the request status and to retrieve
    the deployment results.
